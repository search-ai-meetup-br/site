# Code of Conduct — Search & AI Meetup BR

Search & AI Meetup BR is a community created to promote knowledge sharing, learning, and collaboration around **Information Retrieval, Search Engineering, and Applied Artificial Intelligence**.

We want everyone to feel welcome, safe, and respected in our spaces — both online and in-person.

This Code of Conduct applies to all participants, speakers, organizers, and partners.

## 1. Our community is for everyone

We value the participation of people from different backgrounds, experiences, and levels of knowledge.

We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or exclusion based on — but not limited to:

- Gender, gender identity, or expression  
- Sexual orientation  
- Physical appearance  
- Race, ethnicity, or origin  
- Religion or belief  
- Disability  
- Technical skill level  
- Professional or academic affiliation  

## 2. Be respectful

We expect everyone to:

- Treat others with respect and kindness  
- Assume good intentions in interactions  
- Listen actively and allow all voices to be heard  
- Understand that technical disagreements are normal, but never justify rude or aggressive behavior  

## 3. Unacceptable behavior

The following behaviors will not be tolerated:

- Verbal or physical harassment  
- Intimidation or threats  
- Offensive, discriminatory, or derogatory comments  
- Aggressive interruptions or dominating conversations  
- Unwanted physical contact  
- Sexual harassment of any kind  
- Sharing private information without consent  
- Use of sexualized language or imagery in talks, groups, or materials  

## 4. Safe spaces are also welcoming spaces

We strive to create an environment where:

- Beginners feel comfortable asking questions  
- Experience sharing is encouraged  
- Differences are handled with maturity  
- Criticism is constructive and focused on ideas, not people  


## 5. Reporting issues

If you experience or witness any inappropriate behavior, please contact the organizers immediately.

At in-person events, organizers will be clearly identifiable and available to talk discreetly and safely.

## 6. Consequences and actions

The organization may take actions such as:

- Verbal warnings  
- Removal from online groups  
- Requests for formal apologies  
- Removal from in-person events without refund  
- Communication with partners or authorities in severe cases  

All decisions will be made with the well-being of the community in mind.

## 7. Our commitment

- Enforcing this Code of Conduct consistently and fairly  
- Supporting those who report incidents  
- Creating increasingly inclusive events and spaces  
- Cultivating an open, diverse, and respectful community  

## 8. Agreement

By participating in online groups or attending meetups, all members agree to follow this Code of Conduct.

Together, we can build a strong, collaborative, and healthy Search & AI community in Brazil. 💛
